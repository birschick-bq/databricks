# ADBC Drivers for Databricks

This repository contains [ADBC drivers](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/) for
Databricks, implemented in different languages.

## For Power BI

If you use [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-bi),
follow these instructions to connect to Databricks using the C#-based ADBC driver:

- [Arrow Database Connectivity (ADBC) driver for Power BI](https://docs.databricks.com/partners/bi/power-bi-adbc)

## For Other Applications

Prebuilt versions of the Go-based ADBC driver are available from the
[Columnar](https://columnar.tech) driver registry. These can be
installed using [dbc](https://columnar.tech/dbc):

```sh
dbc install databricks
```

After installing the Go-based driver using dbc, see examples showing how
to use it with various languages:

- [C++](https://github.com/columnar-tech/adbc-quickstarts/tree/main/cpp/databricks)
- [Go](https://github.com/columnar-tech/adbc-quickstarts/tree/main/go/databricks)
- [Java](https://github.com/columnar-tech/adbc-quickstarts/tree/main/java/databricks)
- [Python](https://github.com/columnar-tech/adbc-quickstarts/tree/main/python/databricks)
- [R](https://github.com/columnar-tech/adbc-quickstarts/tree/main/r/databricks)
- [Rust](https://github.com/columnar-tech/adbc-quickstarts/tree/main/rust/databricks)

See [Building](#building) if you would rather build the drivers yourself.
